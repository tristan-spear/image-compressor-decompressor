<ul>
  <li>Used huffman encoding to compress BMP images, with pixel level encoding using C</li>
  <li>Implemented frequency analysis and Huffman tree construction for RGB channels, including bit-level packing of variable-length codes for efficient storage</li>
  <li>Added a configurable quality/loss factor, adjusting color-space quantization to balance compression ratio and fidelity.</li>
